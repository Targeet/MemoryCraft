INTRODUCTION

This game is called MemoryCraft, it's made in python and it is a LAN multiplayer game, meaning you can play it with other people if they are in the same Network.
The game works with a Client-Server architecture, you NEED to run the server to be able to play the game with other people.

MEMORYCRAFT RULES

The rules of the game are very simple.
When the game starts, all the players get the same board of cards.
On each turn, the player has 2 moves, he has to click 2 cards and try to match them.
If he successfully manages to match the cards, he gets to play another turn.
The game goes on until all the cards are matched and finally the game ends, revealing a leaderboard.

PYGAME

To make this game in python, i used a library called pygame, it helps with drawing things in the screen aswell as managing game loops and all kinds of game-related things.
